\section{Introduction}

In 2016 Spring Festival, I solve some problems in Project Euler 
\footnote{In fact, I solve 70+ problems before my interest fade.}, 
which may be most famous online judge 
in Internet except Leetcode. I have noticed the interesting data structure related with rank and difficulty.
But I lacked enough powerful statistic tool to process and model it. 
In fact, I model it as a ordinary least squard which is not understood by me in the time. In the naive period,
linear regression model seems like a poor black box model that often be meeted in Machine Learning algorithm.
